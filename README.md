React Light/Dark Mode Application
This is a simple React application that allows users to switch between light and dark mode. It is built using Vite, React, CSS, and HTML.

Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/vite-react-light-dark-mode.git
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the development server:
bash
Copy code
npm run dev

Usage
To switch between light and dark mode, simply click the toggle button in the right bottom of the form.

How it Works
The application uses React's context api to keep track of the current mode (either light or dark).
When the user toggles between modes, the href attribute of the link tag that points to the appropriate CSS file is updated.
